       <p>This is an experimental webpage that I can use to practice the HTML and CSS that I have been learning with TeamTreehouse.</p>

     <h2>Moving Items On My page</h2>

     <div>
       <p>I am wondering how I can move my "logo" to the upper left hand corner of my page.  I think it would look really good in that spot.  I would also like to move the navigation up.  I decided to try to learn web design because I would like to make a career change.  Learning web design on my own time would give me the experience I need to find a new job.  I'm a little mystified about how to use the grid right now.</p>

     <h2>These Are My Lovely Little Doggies</h2>

       <h3>Roxy</h3>
       <P>Roxy is a quiet dog.  She enjoys chewing on her paw <br> and begging for food and attention.</P>

     <div id="ruby" class="grid_6 omega">
      <h3>Ruby</h3>
      <p>Ruby is very dominant.  She likes to lick your face and <br> put her paws on your chest, just to let you know she's <br> there.</p>

  <div id="smckc" class="grid_12">
    <h2>SMCKC</h2> 
    <p>I have been a part of the Social Media Club of Kansas City for a little over a year.  I found out about the club while attending another event called Kansas City Geek Night.  One of the people I met at Geek Night was the events chair for SMCKC and she told me I should come to their happy hour.</p>

    <p>After going to the SMCKC happy hour I was hooked.  I met so many cool people I decided to go to their friday breakfast.  The breakfast is once a month on friday morning.  There is always a speaker and about 60-70 people ususally attend.</p>
