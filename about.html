	  <h1>Early Days</h1>    
		<p>I was born in Kansas City on a cold dark night in March of 1982.  My mom was in labor and my dad was watching the NCAA tournament on TV in the waiting room.</p>
	  <h2>Oakwood</h2>
		<p> When I was little I went to <a href="http://www.oakwoodcountryclub.org" target="_blank">Oakwood Country Club</a> summer camp.  We played tennis and golf and learned how to swim.  We also had a camp overnight which was a lot of fun.  We got to swim in the pool late at night.  We were always looking out for Old Man Geezer, the ghost of Oakwood.  He would appear in the window of the clubhouse by the putting green.</p>

    	<h2>HBHA</h2>

      	<p>When I went off to Kindergarden I went to the <a href="http://www.hbha.edu/podium/default.aspx?t=132745" target="_blank">Hyman Brand Hebrew Academy.</a> The school was on college blvd. between Nall and Lamar.  They were building a new campus and they made us walk from the old school to the new school.  It wasn't very far but when you are five years old it seemed like a long trek!</p>

      	<p>The school moved to the new campus after my first year.  My parents held me back so I did Kindergarden again at the new campus.  I was a trouble maker that second year because I had already been through it all once.  I thought I was cool.</p>

      <p>After second grade I went to Leawood Elementary school.  I was a Leawood Leopard. I thought the new school was wierd and I missed my friends at the HBHA.</p>

    	<p>Leawood Middle school was the next stop.  We were the Eagles and oh boy was it fun!</p>
