    	<h1>Cooking</h1>
    	<p>How did I get into cooking, you may ask.  Well, I will tell you.....</p>
    	<p>It starts way back when I was little.  You see, I have always been a creative person.  I love to sing, I did drawing and painting when as a kid, and I played guitar. So it is only natural that eventually I found my way into the kitchen.</p>
    	<p>The main catalyst for going into the kitchen was moving away to college. There are only so many frozen dinners and dining out that one can handle.  So I decided needed to learn how to cook. </p>

        <h2>JCCC Hospitality Management Program</h2>
        <p>I was working at Marisco's Pasta and Seafood restaurant in Lawrence, KS when I learned about the hospitality managment program at <a href="http://www.jccc.edu/hospitality-culinary/" target="_blank">Johnson County Community College</a>. I wanted to learn how to cook, so I decided to sign up.</p>
        <p>I started as a chef apprentice but I couldn't find a chef to work under so I switched to food and beverage management. I learned how to cook some in class, but I didn't really learn how to cook until I worked with Sam Cross and Zach Churchill at the Peppercorn Duck Club.  They were the two best chefs I have every worked with and they really made me want to be a great chef.</p>

        <p>These days I am a restaurant manager and I do all my cooking at home.  Check out some of the food that I make below:</p>
